Focaloid:

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focaloid

	Ref: "Physical Significance" - two different, but confocal focaloids of same mass produce same
	action on test mass in exterior region!

	The 'sigma' parameter (as additive term in ellipsoid function denominators) produces a focaloid.
	This suggests that the dilated ellipsoid might be useful for other gravity-relationships, in
	addition to Cartesian/geographic conversions.
